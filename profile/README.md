🛡️ V.O.S 🛡️ <br>
Very Own Security is an independent organization which aims to contribute Networking and Security Applications. 

We desire that one day, our products provide a free-of-cost network solution, that can rival a professional enterprise.
To achieve that, V.O.S requires the help of the good people all over the world, as we alone cannot design everything

👨‍💻 The Founder 👨‍💻 <br>
Applied Computer Science undergraduate
majoring in Network Security
My first two years revolved around software fundamentals, theory, math, and full-stack development ranging from web technologies such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript, to platforms such as JAVA EE ☕ and .NET

I am finishing up my degree as a part-time student, and working a general front-desk Security gig to pay my tuition.
On my free time, I enjoy drumming and composing some music. So, to get better at tech, I plan on making some "music" here as well
